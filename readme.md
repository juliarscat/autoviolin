Hello everyone! 🎻✨

I came up with a system to help people with reduced mobility play the violin. The system is primitive and needs many improvements, but I don’t have the budget to make it better. 💡

The system uses Arduino, lots of Dupont cables, servomotors, stepper motors, and especially many screws. Each servomotor that imitates the bow is connected to a stepper motor to rotate a disc to mimic the bow, and this is placed over one of the violin strings. 🎶🔧

All parts have been designed with a 3D printer, and the files are available for free on Thingiverse. This is a prototype and is in constant progress. 🛠️📈
